Huh? Got a bit of a good vibe from you two, yeah? A feeling of compatibility, yeah?

Looking at it objectively, you’re well-matched, yeah? Got similar taste in hobbies, music and the like, yeah?

You ain’t got a bad face, yeah!

Huh? Got a bit of a good vibe from you two, yeah? A feeling of compatibility, yeah?

Surely your encounter’s a miracle, yeah? Are you the type of believe in fate and such?

We’ll mediate it for you!


Love and affection, let’s rush over that stuff,

So how ‘bout trying to use your sixth sense, yeah,

Just for a bit, can I make fun of you?

Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

And then: Register! Register! Register! Register! Register! Register!!!!!


It would be great if, in an upbeat mood, you tried to register your marriage, yeah. You two are well-matched, yeah. That’s happy, yeah,

Let’s have you two always be together from here on out,

Hurry up and send your marriage registration to the courts,

It would be great if you tried to register your marriage, yeah. What happens after that, we’re not responsible for,

But it’ll definitely go well somehow or another, that’s the feeling we got.


Huh? Truly, you got a bit of a good vibe, yeah? You’re practically a couple already, yeah!

Come out with your earnest thoughts, yeah! You’re going to seriously try to go to the municipal office, yeah.

Eh? Seriously? You’re trying to go to the municipal office, yeah...

Is that okay? Is that seriously okay??

No, if is was okay, that would be fine but,

Are you okay with that? Is that seriously alright??

Eh, it really is okay???????


Love and affection, let’s rush over that stuff,

So how ‘bout using your intuition, yeah. Now, hurry up and throw away that calm judgment,

Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

And then: Register! Register! Register! Register! Register! Register!!!!!


It would be great if, in an upbeat mood, you tried to register your marriage, yeah. You two are well-matched, yeah. That’s happy, yeah,

A quick way for you two to always be together from here on out, pay for Zexy and plan a ceremony,

It would be great if you tried to register your marriage, yeah. You’ll probably divorce within 2 years,

You’re thinking that deep down, but plan on keeping it a secret, hey.



Having a sense of money despite the body’s affinity for a sense of value,

Both carrying tons of unspeakable passed days and days you want to erase,

The issue of the psychologically abuse mother-in-law, the unavoidable infidelity,

Worries are there, but well...



It would be great if, in an upbeat mood, you tried to register your marriage, yeah. You two are well-matched, yeah. That’s happy, yeah,

Let’s have you two always be together from here on out,

Hurry up and send your marriage registration to the courts,

It would be great if you tried to register your marriage, yeah. What happens after that, we’re not responsible for,

But it’ll definitely go well somehow or another, that’s the feeling we got.

It would be great if you tried to register your marriage, yeah. You’ll probably divorce within 2 years, but...

It would be great great great if you tried to register your marriage, yeah,



Congratulations!!!! Congratulations on your marriage!!!

Happy wedding.
