A student who got into one of the Sankinkouryuu,

Clad in uniform, tends to attend uni.

A student who got into one of the Kankandouritsu,

Some way or another, tends to find a job at a good company.

A freshman done with being a high school girl.

Someway or another, tends to be embraced by the upperclassman she doesn’t love.

Those scars tend to stretch a lifetime.

5 people riding in a light automobile,

Making lots of memories in these 4 years!

Way way way wa-way way wa-way way!

Way way way wa-way way wa-way!

Way way way wa-way way wa-way!

Making a racket the whole way!

After a toast of sour cocktails at the Torikizoku,

We play all night in the Spo-cha!

The most important things are not school credits but play and sleep!

Way way way wa-way way wa-way way!

Way way way wa-way way wa-way!

Way way way wa-way way wa-way!

Making a racket the whole way!

After a toast of sour cocktails at the Torikizoku,

We play all night in the Spo-cha!

We’re a bunch of way way college students!

On our way to flunking our classes and taking another year,

Way way college students!


5 people riding in a light automobile,

We’re gonna make lots of memories in these 4 years!

Way way way wa-way way wa-way way!

Way way way wa-way way wa-way!

Way way way wa-way way wa-way!

Making a racket the whole way!

After a toast of sour cocktails at the Torikizoku,

We play all night in the Spo-cha!

The most important things are not school credits but play and sleep!

Way way way wa-way way wa-way way!

Way way way wa-way way wa-way!

Way way way wa-way way wa-way!

Making a racket the whole way!

After a toast of sour cocktails at the Torikizoku,

We play all night in the Spo-cha!

We’re a bunch of way way college students!

On our way to getting flamed on Twitter or Facebook,

Way way college students!
